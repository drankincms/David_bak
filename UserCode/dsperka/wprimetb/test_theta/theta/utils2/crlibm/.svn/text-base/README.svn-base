This is a small part of the CRlibm, the correctly rounded mathematical library,
http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm/
as their logarithm function performs about as twice as fast as the standard gcc math library's.

To use it, switch on crmlib by using
mkdir build; cd build
cmake .. -Dcrlibm:bool=ON
