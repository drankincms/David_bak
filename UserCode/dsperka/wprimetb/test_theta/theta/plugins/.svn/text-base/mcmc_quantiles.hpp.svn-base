/** \brief Construct quantiles of the marginal posterior in one parameter based on Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo
 *
 * The result can be used to give upper limits or to construct symmetric credible intervals.
 *
 * Configuration is done via a setting group like
 * \code
 * hypotest = {
 *   type = "mcmc_quantiles";
 *   name = "quant";
 *   parameter = "s";  //assuming "s" was defined as parameter earlier
 *   quantiles = [0.025, 0.16, 0.5, 0.84, 0.975];
 *   iterations = 10000;
 *   burn-in = 100; //optional. default is iterations / 10
 * };
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * \c type is always "mcmc_posterior_ratio" to select this producer.
 *
 * \c name is a unique producer name of your choice; it is used to construct column names in the output database. It may only contain alphanumeric
 *    characters (no spaces, special characters, etc.).
 *
 * \c parameter is the name of the parameter you want to find the quantiles for
 *
 * \c quantiles is a list or array of floating point values specifying the quantiles you want. Be aware that
 *   specifying very similar quantiles (with a difference less than 0.00001) is not allowed as this would yield same column
 *   name in the result table; see below.
 *
 * \c iterations is the number of MCMC iterations. See additional comments about runtime and suggested robustness tests
 *     in the documentation of \link mcmc_posterior_ratio mcmc_posterior_ratio \endlink.
 *
 * \c burn_in is the number of MCMC iterations to do at the beginning and throw away. See additional comments in the
 *     documentation of \link mcmc_posterior_ratio mcmc_posterior_ratio \endlink
 *
 * For each data given, one chain will be used to derive all requested quantiles given in the \c quantiles list, so their error
 * from limited chain length is correlated by construction. If you do not want that, use two independent producers of type
 * mcmc_quantiles.
 *
 * The result table contains as many columns as \c quantiles given in the configuration file. The column name
 * will be "quant" + 10000 * quantile, written with leading zeros. For example, if the quantile is 0.5,
 * the column name will be "quant05000", if the 99.9% quantile is requested (i.e., 0.999), the name will be "quant09990".
